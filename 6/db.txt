what is sql
-->sql stands for : structure query language. 
mysql is not a language.
mysql(db)mysql is file.and file can not directly access.talk to db<--- sql(language)

what is database ?
-->it is collection of data in a formate that can be easily accessed.
why database
-->can store large amount of data
-->features like security,scalability etc..
-->easier to delete,update,insert or search 
eg.think of like that goverment store the large amount of data like physical file. slowly slowly change to physical to digital data store like computer.

what is dbms.
-->dbms means manage the data.think of like it we can have large amount of data.but only for data.but not handle manually.dbms handle the database   database --> dbms 

sql v/s nosql                                    
sql
-->relational database (data stored in tables)
eg - MySQL ,oracle,postgreSQL etc.
NoSQL 
non relational database (data stored in document/key-value/graphs etc.)
eg-MongoDB,cassandra,Neo4j etc.



1)how to database create 
-->CREATE DATABASE db_name
-->create database db_name

2)how to database delete 
-->DROP DATABASE db_name

3)how to use database
-->USE db_name

4)how to create a table name 
-->create table table_name(
    column_name1 datatype constraint,
    column_name2 datatype constraint,
    column_name3 datatype constraint
);

5)how to insert table value 
insert into table_name
value
(101,"yug",18),
(101,"utsav",19); 

6)how to table show
-->select column_name1 column_name2 from table_name
-->select * from table_name;
-->select distinct column_name1 from table_name  -->distinct are remove duplicate value.

7)create database db_name;
create database if not exists db_name; -->this query means if database are already exists not create a database but database are not exists then create a database.

8)DROP database db_name;
DROP database if exists db_name; -->this means if database exists then delete database.but database are not exists then given warning.

9)how to show all database & table
-->show databases;
-->show tables;

10)table queries : create , insert , update , alter , truncate , delete 
-->1)ALTER : 
     ALTER is used to change an existing table — like adding, removing, or changing a column.
     1)how to add column name :
     --> alter table student add marks int;
     2)how to rename column name : 
     --> alter table student rename enroll_number to roll_number;
     3)how to rename table name :
     --> alter table student rename new-table_name;
     4)how to change datatype : 
     --> alter table student modify marks float;
     5)how to remove column :
     --> alter table student drop column marks;

11)constraint : rules for data in the table 
not null : columns can not have a null value
unique : all values in column are different
defualt : sets the defualt value of a column.
check : it can limit the values allowed in a tupple_name datatype defualt values;
-->example :
            create database company;

            use company;

            create table employees(
            id int unique,
            name varchar(20) not null,
            email varchar(50),
            salary int default 3000,
            age int,
            constraint age_check check (age >= 18)
            );

            drop table employees;

            INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email, age)
            VALUES
            (1, "yug", "yugthummar432@gail.com", 20),
            (2, "krishna", "krishna343@gmail.com", 23);
            
            select * from employees;
12)what is key : key are special column in the table
primary key :  Think of a Primary Key like your Aadhaar number.
               It is unique for every Indian citizen.
               cannot have two people with the same Aadhaar number.
               It helps the government identify you uniquely.
               ➡️ In a database, the Primary Key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table.

        CREATE TABLE Students (
        StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        Name VARCHAR(100)
        );
 
foreign key :   Now think of a Foreign Key as a reference to someone else’s Aadhaar.
                For example, in your school record, your teacher might write your father’s Aadhaar number for reference.
                Your father’s Aadhaar is not unique in your record, but it is a valid Aadhaar from another person (another table).
                ➡️ In databases, a Foreign Key connects one table to another using a valid reference.
                Create a Books table where each book has a unique BookID and a Title.
primary key : it is a column (or set of column) in a table that uniquely identifies each row.(a unique id)
there is only  1 PK & it should be NOT null.
foreign key : a foreign key is a column(or set of column)in a table that refers to the primary key in another table.
FKs can have duplicate & null values.
there can be multiple FKs.

13)WHERE clause : The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records. It returns only the rows that meet a specific condition.
🔹 Basic Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
🔹 Example:
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 18;
➡️ This query returns all students whose age is greater than 18.

14)where clause operators :
-->arithmatic operators : +(addition), -(subtraction),*(multiplication),/(division),%(modulus)
-->comparison operators : =(equal to),!=(not equal to),>,<,<=,>=
-->logical operators : AND ,OR,NOT,IN ,BETWEEN,ALL,LIKE,ANY
-->bitwise operators : &(bitwise AND),| (bitwise or)

15)where clause frequently used operators
AND(to check for both condition to be true)
or(to check for one of the condition to be true)
BETWEEN(select for a given range)
in(matches any value in the list)
not(to nagate the given condition)

16)order by clause : to sort in ascending (ASC) or descending order (DESC).
-->select column1,column2 from table_name
    order by column_name(s) ASC,DESC;

17)LIMIT clause : set an upper limit on number of (tuples) rows to be retuened.
-->SELECT column1,column2 from table_name limit number

18)aggregate functions :"to group together and summarize". perform a calculation on a set of values,and return a singal value.
-->count()
-->sum()
-->max()
-->min()
-->avg()
example : select max(follower)

19)group by clause :  
                    -->groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
                    -->it collects data fOR multiple records and groups the result by one or more column.
                    -->select column_name1,column_name2 form table_name
                    group by column_name(s);
                    -->genereally we use group by with some aggregation function.

20)having clause : having clause apply for groups condition
                  --> similar to where i.e. applies some condition on rows.
                  -->but it is used when we want to apply any condition after grouping.
                  select column_name1,column_name2
                  from table_name
                  group by column_name(s)
                  having condition;
                
21)general order : select(column(s))
                   from(column)
                   where(column)
                   group by(column(s))
                   having(condition)
                   order by(column(s)) ASC; 

22)update : to update existing rows.
-->update table_name
   set column_name1 = value, column_name2 = value
   where condition;
-->delete : to delete existing rows
   delete from table_name
   where condition;
-->truncate : to delete table data not the delete table.
   truncate table table_name;

practice QS :
-->create a database for your college.
-->create a table named teacher to store (id,name,subject,salary)
-->insert following data in the table : 
23,"ajay","math",50000
47,"bharat","english",60000
18,"chetan","chemistry",45000
9,"divya","physics",75000
1)-->select teachers whose salary is more than 55k.
2)-->rename the salary column of teacher table to ctc.
3)-->update salary of all teachers by giving them an increment of 25%.
4)-->add a new column for teachers called city.the default city should br "Gurgaon".
5)-->delete the salary column for teacher table.

"-------------------------"Node with SQL"----------------------------
faker is generate a fake data

client ---->server------>database
-->client not directly connected to database.client request a server and server request the database.but database and server are not link server work on node and database work on sql query.so server and database connected to install npm i mysql2.which connected server and database.
-->in mysql2 included createConnection() name  
how to mysql workbench here -->mysql -u root -p;
how to run sql in js node index.js
how many type's to run mysql
1)workbench
2)mysql package ->node.js
3)CLI 
4)using sql_files ->run->create a sql file. and write sql query. open terminal write the command "mysql -u root -p". enter a password. choose database and run command->"source file_name"
